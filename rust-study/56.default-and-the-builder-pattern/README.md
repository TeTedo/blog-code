# 56. Default and the builder pattern

Default trait 는 기본값을 제공해주는 트레이트이다.

```rs
fn main() {
    println!("{}, {}, {}", i32::default(), String::default(), bool::default());
}

0, , false
```

default trait 을 구현해서 struct 를 만들어보자.

```rs
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Character {
    name: String,
    age: u8,
    height: u32,
    weight: u32,
    lifestate: LifeState,
}

#[derive(Debug)]
enum LifeState {
    Alive,
    Dead,
    NeverAlive,
    Uncertain
}

impl Character {
    fn new(name: String, age: u8, height: u32, weight: u32, alive: bool) -> Self {
        Self { 
            name, 
            age, 
            height, 
            weight, 
            lifestate: if alive { LifeState::Alive } else { LifeState::Dead } 
        }
    }
}

impl Default for Character {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Self {
            name: String::from("Default Name"),
            age: 18,
            height: 180,
            weight: 70,
            lifestate: LifeState::Uncertain
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let character_1 = Character::new(String::from("John"), 20, 180, 70, true);
    let character_2 = Character::default();
    println!("character_1: {:?}", character_1);
    println!("character_2: {:?}", character_2);
}
```

```rs
character_1: Character { name: "John", age: 20, height: 180, weight: 70, lifestate: Alive }
character_2: Character { name: "Default Name", age: 18, height: 180, weight: 70, lifestate: Uncertain }
```

다음은 builder pattern 을 실제로 구현을 먼저 해보면 아래와 같다.

1. can use flag 사용

```rs
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Character {
    name: String,
    age: u8,
    height: u32,
    weight: u32,
    lifestate: LifeState,
    can_use: bool, // Here is the new value
}

#[derive(Debug)]
enum LifeState {
    Alive,
    Dead,
    NeverAlive,
    Uncertain,
}

impl Character {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            name: "Billy".to_string(),
            age: 15,
            height: 170,
            weight: 70,
            lifestate: LifeState::Alive,
            can_use: true,  // .new() makes a fine character, so it is true
        }
    }

    fn height(mut self, height: u32) -> Self {
        self.height = height;
        self.can_use = false; // Now the user can't use the character
        self
    }

    fn weight(mut self, weight: u32) -> Self {
        self.weight = weight;
        self.can_use = false;
        self
    }

    fn name(mut self, name: &str) -> Self {
        self.name = name.to_string();
        self.can_use = false;
        self
    }

    fn build(mut self) -> Result<Character, String> {
        if self.height < 200 && self.weight < 300 && !self.name.to_lowercase().contains("smurf") {
            self.can_use = true;   // Everything is okay, so set to true
            Ok(self)               // and return the character
        } else {
            Err("Could not create character. Characters must have:
1) Height below 200
2) Weight below 300
3) A name that is not Smurf (that is a bad word)"
                .to_string())
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let character_with_smurf = Character::new().name("Lol I am Smurf!!").build(); // This one contains "smurf" - not okay
    let character_too_tall = Character::new().height(400).build(); // Too tall - not okay
    let character_too_heavy = Character::new().weight(500).build(); // Too heavy - not okay
    let okay_character = Character::new()
        .name("Billybrobby")
        .height(180)
        .weight(100)
        .build();   // This character is okay. Name is fine, height and weight are fine

    // Now they are not Character, they are Result<Character, String>. So let's put them in a Vec so we can see them:
    let character_vec = vec![character_with_smurf, character_too_tall, character_too_heavy, okay_character];

    for character in character_vec { // Now we will print the character if it's Ok, and print the error if it's Err
        match character {
            Ok(character_info) => println!("{:?}", character_info),
            Err(err_info) => println!("{}", err_info),
        }
        println!(); // Then add one more line
    }
}
```

2. characterBuilder 사용

```rs
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Character {
    name: String,
    age: u8,
    height: u32,
    weight: u32,
    lifestate: LifeState,
}

#[derive(Debug)]
struct CharacterBuilder {
    name: String,
    age: u8,
    height: u32,
    weight: u32,
    lifestate: LifeState,
}

#[derive(Debug)]
enum LifeState {
    Alive,
    Dead,
    NeverAlive,
    Uncertain,
}

impl CharacterBuilder {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            name: "Billy".to_string(),
            age: 15,
            height: 170,
            weight: 70,
            lifestate: LifeState::Alive,
        }
    }

    fn height(mut self, height: u32) -> Self {
        self.height = height;
        self
    }

    fn weight(mut self, weight: u32) -> Self {
        self.weight = weight;
        self
    }

    fn name(mut self, name: &str) -> Self {
        self.name = name.to_string();
        self
    }

    fn build(mut self) -> Result<Character, String> {
        if self.height < 200 && self.weight < 300 && !self.name.to_lowercase().contains("smurf") {
            Ok(Character {
                name: self.name,
                age: self.age,
                height: self.height,
                weight: self.weight,
                lifestate: self.lifestate,
            })
        } else {
            Err("Could not create character. Characters must have:
1) Height below 200
2) Weight below 300
3) A name that is not Smurf (that is a bad word)"
                .to_string())
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let character_with_smurf = CharacterBuilder::new().name("Lol I am Smurf!!").build(); // This one contains "smurf" - not okay
    let character_too_tall = CharacterBuilder::new().height(400).build(); // Too tall - not okay
    let character_too_heavy = CharacterBuilder::new().weight(500).build(); // Too heavy - not okay
    let okay_character = CharacterBuilder::new()
        .name("Billybrobby")
        .height(180)
        .weight(100)
        .build();   // This character is okay. Name is fine, height and weight are fine

    // Now they are not Character, they are Result<Character, String>. So let's put them in a Vec so we can see them:
    let character_vec = vec![character_with_smurf, character_too_tall, character_too_heavy, okay_character];

    for character in character_vec { // Now we will print the character if it's Ok, and print the error if it's Err
        match character {
            Ok(character_info) => println!("{:?}", character_info),
            Err(err_info) => println!("{}", err_info),
        }
        println!(); // Then add one more line
    }
}
```
